## What's in the PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular structure info is the PDB <www.rcsb.org>. Let's see what this database contains:


```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv",row.names=1)
stats
```
> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
as.numeric(stats$X.ray)
as.numeric(stats$EM)
```
We got to get rid of commas. Can you find a function to get rid of commas?

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
```
I'm going to turn this into a function and then use `apply()` to work on the entire table of data

```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}
sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
n.total <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
sumcomma(stats$EM)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)/ sumcomma(stats$Total)
```
A: 84.13% percent of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and 9.2% solved by Electron Microscopy.

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
apply(stats[,-ncol(stats)], 1, sumcomma)
```
```{r}
apply(stats[,-ncol(stats)], 1, sumcomma)/(sumcomma(stats$Total))
```

A: 86.6% of structures in the PDB are protein.

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

A: 26812 HIV-1 protease structures in the current PDB.

In Uniprot there are 248,805,733 entries, which, compared to PDB protein entries (186,898), means there are only 0.07% of known sequences with a known structure.

```{r}
186898/248805733*100
```

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* ("mol-star") viewer is now everywhere. The Mol* homepage at https://molstar.org/viewer/. I want to insert my image from Mol* here.

## Working with the bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```
```{r}
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (i.e. flexibility/dynamics):

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
```
```{r}
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
```
```{r}
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative Analysis of Protein Structures

Here we will work through a complete pipeline of analysis for a given protein family starting from one single database ID for a member of this family all the way to a deeper understanding of structure, dynamics and function.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"

aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

```{r}
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```


```{r}
#hits <- NULL
#hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
# Download related PDB files
#files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
#pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

print out the alignment!
```{r}
#pdbs
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
#ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
#plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```


```{r}
# Perform PCA
#pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
#plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
#pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
